## **Project Overview**

![Dashboard](./DB.png)

The **BlinkIT Grocery Sales Dashboard** is designed to help stakeholders understand key business metrics like total sales, average sales, number of items sold, and average ratings across different outlets. This project demonstrates my ability to perform data extraction, transformation, and visualization using Power BI.

## **Technical Details**

### **Tools and Technologies Used:**
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Excel**: Data source for sales and outlet data
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating calculated measures and columns
- **SQL (optional)**: For data cleaning and preprocessing (if integrated with databases)

### **Key Components:**
- **Data Modeling**: Relationships were established between tables to ensure accurate aggregations and filtering.
- **DAX Measures**:
  - Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Sales Amount])
  - Average Sales = AVERAGE(Sales[Sales Amount])
  - Number of Items = COUNT(Sales[Item ID])
  - Average Rating = AVERAGE(Sales[Rating])
- **Visualizations**:
  - **KPI Cards**: Highlight key metrics (Total Sales, Avg Sales, No. of Items, Avg Rating)
  - **Stacked Bar Chart**: Sales by Outlet Type and Item Fat Content
  - **Pie Chart**: Sales distribution by Outlet Size
  - **Line Chart**: Sales trend by Outlet Establishment Year
  - **Horizontal Bar Charts**: Sales by Item Type and Fat Content
  - **Table**: Outlet performance summary
- **Filters and Slicers**:
  - Outlet Location Type, Outlet Size, Item Type for dynamic filtering.
